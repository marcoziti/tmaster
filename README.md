Time Master
-----------

#### description ####
**tmaster**, a simple count-down timer written in C with FLTK, CMake, mingw and importantly with notpate2. It's written in flight to Frankfurt so as to have an timer for a brainstorming session in a workshop.

#### how to build ####
1. Download mingw-gcc. I use [mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/).
2. Download [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/). 
3. Download [FLTK 1.3](http://www.fltk.org/) source code.
4. Build FLTK with cmake, mingw-w64.
5. When you successfully build FLTK with cmake, you shall NOW be able to build tmaster with cmake as well.

Enjoy.
